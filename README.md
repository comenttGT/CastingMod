# CastingMod
This is my First ever Casting Mod, so there will probably be some Issues/Bugs with it.
It is Open source so you can create your own Casting Mod, but with credits ofc ;)
If you want to modify/create from the mod, make sure to read the LICENSE!!

Controls:

0-9 | Changes to the associated Player.
Enter | Changes to First/Third Person View
Up Arrow | Make FOV Higher
Down Arrow | Make FOV Lower
Tab | Toggles Nametags
Escape | Ends Spectating
